This is a [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) containing **Mission statistics of the protection and rescue service** (*Einsatzstatistik von Schutz und Rettung Zürich*) from the City of Zurich since 2010. It was created as an example during a course in [Data Analysis](https://www.ti.bfh.ch/cas-da) at the Bern University of Applied Sciences.

# Data

The single CSV file in the `data` folder contains various statistics across columns, one year per row, with attributes documented in the data package descriptor.

# Source

The data was found on [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/einsatzstatistik-von-schutz-und-rettung-zurich-seit-2010), and downloaded from the Open Data Portal of the City of Zürich: https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/srz_einsatzstatistik

The [Data Packagist](http://datapackagist.openknowledge.io/) tool from Open Knowledge was used to process the CSV and create `datapackage.json`. The titles and descriptions of the fields were also obtained from the City of Zürich portal.
